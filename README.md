## Project Description

ResQDoc is a life-saving application designed to assist paramedics and users in quickly and efficiently summarizing emergency situations, particularly after completing CPR. The application provides a series of yes/no questions to determine the situation, followed by a free speech section with speech-to-text functionality for detailed descriptions.

Multiple users in the area can complete the summary from their personal Android devices, providing diverse perspectives on the situation. The summaries are then sent to a server, where an AI model processes the input and determines the health issue of the patient. If additional information is needed, the AI generates questions for the users to gather more details.

Once the AI has a comprehensive understanding of the situation, it contacts the ambulance personnel with a summary of what happened, recommended treatments, and potential risks to the patient.
